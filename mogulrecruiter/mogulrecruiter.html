        <div class="project-description">
            <p>With new features like job description-to-keywords matching, AI resume ranking, and a built-in CRM, the Mogul Recruiter product had started to feel cluttered and harder to navigate. Recruiters weren't sure where to start their search or how to move efficiently from sourcing to outreach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section" style="margin-top: 80px !important;">
            <div class="about-left">
                <p>I talked with our executive recruitment team, the Client Success team, and both high and low-usage clients to understand where people were getting stuck. Recruiters were often confused by the navigation and unsure where to start a search. The process of sourcing, reviewing, and reaching out to candidates didn't have a clear flow, which left users unsure what to do next. I mapped out user journeys to spot these gaps and figure out where friction was happening.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-right">
                <img src="../images/currentflowa.jpg" alt="Current Flow A">
                <div class="image-pagination">1/2</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="project-description-solution">
            <p>Two potential paths emerged
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">1. Redesign the navigation to make key actions clearer and reduce unnecessary steps.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">2. Completely rethink the experience to address deeper usability issues.</p>
            </p>
                <p>I chose a full redesign, understanding it would take more time but believing it was the right long-term investment to make the product scalable and future-ready. The new experience was restructured around a job-centric model, where all related actions (sourcing, candidate review, campaigns, and progress tracking) live in one place. This gave recruiters a single, focused workspace instead of a scattered experience. I also simplified the navigation, clarified the flow, and reduced visual clutter to make it easier to move from one stage to the next.</p>

        <div class="project-info">
            <div class="project-left">Centralized inbox keeps recruiters on top of their work. See new candidates for jobs, get check-in reminders for inactive projects, update completed project statuses, and optimize outreach when candidates aren't responding. The inbox acts as a dashboard, giving recruiters a clear overview of everything happening in their workflow.</div>

        <div class="project-info">
            <div class="project-left">Sourcing is the first step in hiring, so it needs to be fast and focused. I simplified the search experience to highlight the information recruiters actually use most, like current role and work history. Candidate bios still inform search results in the background, but hiding them from the main view cleaned up the interface and made scanning candidates much faster.</div>

        <div class="project-info">
            <div class="project-left">I redesigned the search filters with a simple icon-based entry point and more intentional spacing, making it easier for recruiters to quickly refine and apply filters.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="project-info">
            <div class="project-left">After sourcing, recruiters move into review mode to narrow the candidate pool. I designed this stage for speed and clarity, with smart sort options like best fit, which matches candidates to the search criteria, and top potential, which predicts who is most likely to succeed based on experience and past roles. Contact details are shown automatically, and recruiters can quickly email or remove candidates directly from the interface, making candidate management faster and more efficient.</div>

        <div class="project-info">
            <div class="project-left">Recruiters can build and schedule personalized email and SMS campaigns directly within each job, making outreach a natural next step after sourcing and reviewing candidates. The system includes built-in analytics so recruiters can track engagement, see which messages are performing best, and adjust their approach to improve results. This integration keeps all candidate activity in one place and makes managing outreach faster and more effective.</div>
