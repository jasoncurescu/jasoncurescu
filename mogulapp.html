          Our community at Mogul was full of ambitious, driven people but many of them shared the same struggle: they
          had big goals and ideas, but didn’t know where to start. The process of setting and managing goals felt
          overwhelming and unclear. Without the right tools or structure, motivation dropped and progress stalled. There
          was a clear need for a simple, approachable way to help people turn their goals into action.
        </p>
        <p class="i-joined-mogul-as">
          I joined Mogul as the first and only designer, stepping into a fast-paced environment where I had the chance
          to shape the product from the ground up. At the time, Mogul was a global content platform for women curating
          everything from articles and videos to courses and community discussions.<br /><br />As the company evolved
          into an AI-powered recruitment platform focused on inclusive hiring, my role evolved too. I worked across
          nearly every design touchpoint from branding, product, web, and app design collaborating closely with the CEO,
          CTO, engineering, and marketing teams. Whether it was building our first design system, creating the Mogul App
          from scratch, or designing tools that helped companies search through 700M+ profiles, my goal was always to
          create thoughtful, scalable solutions that moved the product and business forward.
        </p>
        <p class="text-wrapper-3">
          The Mogul app started with a simple insight from our community. People had so many ideas and goals, but didn’t
          know how to get started. They felt overwhelmed, stuck, and unsure of what to tackle first. We built the app to
          help with exactly that. It’s a space where users can break down their goals, stay organized, and actually make
          progress without the stress. Whether it’s something personal or professional, the Mogul app helps turn
          “someday” into something real.
        </p>
        <p class="text-wrapper-4">
          The first version of the Mogul App was designed as an extension of our website which was centered around
          community and content. But as we began prototyping and testing with users, a clear theme emerged: they wanted
          more than just connection. They wanted support. Through feedback and iteration, we discovered that what users
          really needed was a tool to help them stay focused, build better habits, and make meaningful progress toward
          their goals. That insight became the foundation for what the Mogul App became.
        </p>
        <p class="we-designed-the">
          We designed the Mogul App around two simple but powerful rituals. One to close out the day, and one to start
          fresh. In the evening, users reflect on what went well, what they learned, and what they’d like to improve.
          Then they plan tomorrow’s goals and tasks, adding everything directly to their in-app calendar. In the
          morning, users begin with a clear overview of their day so they can move forward with purpose and focus.<br /><br />By
          combining reflection, planning, and scheduling into one seamless flow, users stay grounded in their goals and
          can see how their small, daily actions build toward bigger outcomes.<br /><br />We also included a community
          feed where users can share progress, ask questions, and support one another. Whether it’s about personal
          growth or career goals, the feed creates space for encouragement and connection among people working to be
          their best.
