                        Hi, I'm Jason Curescu. I'm a senior product designer and I'm currently looking for my next role. For the past seven years, I've been working at a recruitment software company called Mogul. I loved being part of the team and getting to design tools that really helped people. Unfortunately, the company recently shut down, so now I'm looking for a new opportunity where I can keep growing, do great work, and be part of something meaningful.

                    <div class="about-label">VSCO and me</div>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        And on a personal note, I've always loved photography. I remember using VSCO's Lightroom presets when I was just starting out, and it became a big part of how I edited my photos. I'm not a pro, but I understand the creative process and what tools make that process feel good. That's a big reason why I'm excited about this role.

                    <div class="about-label">Value I bring</div>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        At Mogul, I helped lead the shift from a social network to an AI-powered recruitment tool. I worked closely with the CEO, engineers, and product managers to design tools that actually made sense for users and the business. I like being part of big changes like that, where you start with an idea and slowly turn it into something real that people use.

No matter what I'm designing, I always start by talking to people. I've done a lot of user interviews and testing, and I try to understand what people need before jumping into design. Whether it was building sourcing tools at Mogul or launching Aina during the pandemic, I've learned that the best ideas come from listening first.

I've also worked on a lot of projects that started from scratch. I designed the Mogul app from the ground up and built a national farm directory that went from idea to live site in just a few months. I'm comfortable figuring things out as I go, testing ideas, and moving quickly when things are still taking shape.

Before I got into product design, I worked as a graphic designer. That background still shows up in my workâ€”I care about how things look, how they're laid out, and how they tell a story. I think that eye for detail would be a good fit at VSCO, where design and creativity really matter.
