                        </div>
                        <div>The problem:<br>
                            We saw a growing challenge: companies were struggling to find and connect with candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. Since Mogul already had a strong community of diverse professionals, we recognized a real opportunity to bridge that gap. That's how Mogul Recruiter was born. An AI-powered sourcing tool designed to help companies surface talent across key diversity categories like gender, ethnicity, veteran status, and disability.</div>
                    </div>
                   
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>The process:<br>
Redesigning the Mogul recruiter tool started with a lot of listening. I talked to clients and our Customer Success team to understand how recruiters were actually using the product and where things were getting confusing. As more features were added, the experience started to feel messy, so my goal was to simplify it. I mapped out how people moved through the tool, sketched out rough ideas, and had conversations to test if those ideas made sense. I paid close attention to where users got stuck and what they expected to happen next. After a few rounds of refining and tweaking, we landed on a structure that felt clear, intuitive, and way easier to use. The feedback confirmed we were on the right track.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/flows.jpg" alt="mogulprototypes" class="mogul-prototypes"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>The outcome:<br>
                            The redesign centered on one big idea: clarity through structure. I reimagined the experience around a job-centric model where everything (sourcing, candidate review, campaigns, and progress tracking) lives within each job. This shift gave recruiters a single, focused space to get their work done without jumping between disconnected sections. A key part of this was redesigning the menu bar, which had become cluttered and confusing. I streamlined it by merging “Projects” and “My Jobs” into a single “My Jobs” section, surfacing the most recent jobs for quick access. I also moved “Search” and “Sequences” into each job, creating a more intuitive, linear flow that better supports how recruiters actually work.<br><br>
                            Inbox:<br>
                            To support day-to-day workflow, I also designed a new inbox system. A centralized view that keeps recruiters up to date with tasks, updates, and candidate activity.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/inboxrecruiter.png" alt="mogulinbox" class="mogul-inbox"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Sourcing:<br>
                            Sourcing is where the hiring journey begins. It’s about surfacing the right candidates, fast and without distraction. In rethinking this experience, I stripped the interface down to only what recruiters truly need. Through client research, we learned that candidate bios were rarely read at this stage. Instead, recruiters prioritized quick access to essentials like current role and work history. We still factor bios into search relevance behind the scenes, but by removing them from view, we decluttered the UI and improved scanability to make it easier to build high-quality pipelines with speed and intention.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/sourcingrecruiter.png" alt="mogulsourcing" class="mogul-sourcing"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Filters:<br>
                            After sourcing, recruiters enter review mode. Here they narrow down the talent pool and deciding who moves forward. I designed this experience to support speed and clarity, with flexible sort options like "Best Fit" (based on experience match) and "Top Potential" (based on predictive success indicators). Contact info like emails and phone numbers is now auto-revealed, saving clicks and reducing workflow interruptions. Actions like emailing or removing candidates are just a tap away making it easy to keep momentum without leaving the flow.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/filtersrecruiter.png" alt="mogulfiltersrecruiter" class="mogul-filtersrecruiter"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Review:<br>
                            Once you've sourced candidates, you can review and manage all the ones you've saved. Recruiters have the option to sort by "Best Fit," which ranks candidates from most to least suitable based on their experience. There's also a "Top Potential" sort, which highlights candidates most likely to succeed in the role. Additionally, you can email candidates directly or remove them before moving forward with the campaign.</div>

                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Campaign:<br>
                            Campaign creation used to feel like a separate tool. It was disconnected from the sourcing experience. I integrated it directly into each job, making outreach a natural next step instead of an afterthought. Recruiters can now create personalized email and SMS campaigns without breaking stride, and schedule them to match their hiring timelines. Each step includes real-time analytics so teams can track engagement and optimize future outreach. The result: a more cohesive, data-driven approach to connecting with candidates.</div>

                        The problem:<br>
                            In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when grocery stores were struggling to keep shelves stocked, many people didn't realize that local farms still had plenty of fresh food available. They just didn't have a way to reach consumers directly. At the same time, small farms were losing restaurant and wholesale business and needed new ways to sell their products. Aina was created to close that gap, making it easy for people to discover nearby farms and shop from them directly, without middlemen.</div>
                    </div>


                    
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Launch:<br>
                            We first launched in April 2020 under the name Farms That Are Delivering, starting with a simple list of local farms around New York City offering direct-to-door delivery. The initial site was intentionally minimal with just a search bar where users could enter their address and instantly see nearby farms. It was clean, focused, and designed to get people what they needed, fast.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/farms.png" alt="farms that are delivering" class="farms"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Iterating:<br>
                            As the site gained traction on social media and in the press, traffic took off. We were reaching over 1 million searches within the first three months. We reviewed more than 15,000 farms across the U.S. and hand-curated a directory of around 1,300 that offered local or nationwide delivery. For each one, we captured detailed information from product offerings to animal feed, breed, and butchering methods. As we dug into user behavior, we noticed a shift: people didn't just want to search, they wanted to browse. That insight shaped our next design update, where we added city and state-based categories for easier exploration. We also introduced a rotating headline to highlight what was possible to search, helping users instantly understand the full range of the site.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/farmsupdate.png" alt="farms update" class="farmsupdate"></div>

                        <div>Aina:<br>
                            As we continued to grow, we rebranded as Aina which means Hawaiian for 'land' or 'earth'. We began evolving the site with a more intentional focus on user experience. We refined the search flow, adjusted the design based on user behavior, and introduced features for both farmers and customers. With more farms reaching out to join, we added an 'Add My Farm' feature that let them create accounts and list their own products. On the customer side, we highlighted standout farms doing things differently like Parker Pastures, where cows graze year-round on Colorado's wild grasses, or Lava Lake Lamb, where sheep roam freely across a million acres in the Rockies. These curated spotlights helped users connect with the values behind the food and brought a richer, more story-driven experience to the platform.</div>

                        <div>The problem:<br>
                            A lot of people in our community had big goals but didn’t know how to get started. They felt stuck, overwhelmed, and unsure of what to do first. Without a clear way to break things down or stay organized, it was hard to make progress. The process of setting and managing goals felt confusing, and motivation often dropped off. We saw an opportunity to create a simple tool that could help people turn their ideas into action.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>
                            Prototypes & testing:<br>
                            The first version of the Mogul App was designed as an extension of our website which was centered around community and content. But as we began prototyping and testing with users, a clear theme emerged: they wanted more than just connection. They wanted support. Through feedback and iteration, we discovered that what users really needed was a tool to help them stay focused, build better habits, and make meaningful progress toward their goals. That insight became the foundation for what the Mogul App became.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/prototypesapp.png" alt="mogulprototypesapp" class="mogul-prototypesapp"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>The outcome:<br>
                            We designed the Mogul App around two simple but powerful rituals. One to close out the day, and one to start fresh. In the evening, users reflect on what went well, what they learned, and what they'd like to improve. Then they plan tomorrow's goals and tasks, adding everything directly to their in-app calendar. In the morning, users begin with a clear overview of their day so they can move forward with purpose and focus.<br><br>
                            
                            By combining reflection, planning, and scheduling into one seamless flow, users stay grounded in their goals and can see how their small, daily actions build toward bigger outcomes.<br><br>
                            
                            We also included a community feed where users can share progress, ask questions, and support one another. Whether it's about personal growth or career goals, the feed creates space for encouragement and connection among people working to be their best.
