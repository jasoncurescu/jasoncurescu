                            We saw a growing challenge: companies were struggling to find and connect with candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. Since Mogul already had a strong community of diverse professionals, we recognized a real opportunity to bridge that gap. That's how Mogul Recruiter was born. An AI-powered sourcing tool designed to help companies surface talent across key diversity categories like gender, ethnicity, veteran status, and disability.</p>

                        <div>Redesigning the Mogul recruiter tool was all about turning a cluttered, growing product into something clear and easy to use. I started by listening, talking to clients and our Customer Success team to really understand where people were getting stuck and what they needed most. I mapped out user flows, sketched early concepts, and tested them through real conversations to make sure they made sense. I led the full product rethink and focused on simplifying the experience without losing depth. Each round of feedback helped shape a tool that actually matched how recruiters work. The result was a cleaner, more focused experience that teams felt confident using right away.</div>

                            The redesign centered on one big idea: clarity through structure. I reimagined the experience around a job-centric model where everything (sourcing, candidate review, campaigns, and progress tracking) lives within each job. This shift gave recruiters a single, focused space to get their work done without jumping between disconnected sections. A key part of this was redesigning the menu bar, which had become cluttered and confusing.</p>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                         <img src="images/inbox.jpg" alt="inbox" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;" class="filters-image">

                    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 10px auto; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: left;">
                        To support day-to-day workflow, I created a new inbox system. A centralized view that keeps recruiters up to date with tasks, updates, and candidate activity.
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="images/sourcing.jpg" alt="sourcing" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;" class="filters-image">

                    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 10px auto; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: left;">
                        Sourcing is the first step in hiring, so it needs to be fast and focused. I simplified the experience to highlight what recruiters actually use, mainly current role and work history. Bios still help with search in the background, but hiding them cleaned up the UI and made scanning easier.
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="images/filters.jpg" alt="filters" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;" class="filters-image">
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 10px auto; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: left;">
                        I cleaned up the filters by introducing a simple icon-based entry point and more intentional spacing to make it easier to use. I also brought more attention to the Diversity Categories filter so teams could focus on inclusive hiring without extra effort.
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="images/review.jpg" alt="review" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;" class="review-image">

                    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 10px auto; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: left;">
                        After sourcing, recruiters move into review mode to narrow the pool. I designed this flow for speed and clarity, with smart sort options like Best Fit and Top Potential. Contact details show automatically, and actions like emailing or removing candidates are just a tap away.
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="images/campaign.jpg" alt="campaign" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;" class="campaign-image">

                    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 10px auto; margin-bottom: 100px; text-align: left;">
                        Campaigns used to feel separate from sourcing, so I integrated them into each job to make outreach a natural next step. Recruiters can now build and schedule personalized email and SMS campaigns with built-in analytics to track engagement and improve results.
                    </div>

                    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 40px 0 0 0; display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                            In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when grocery stores were struggling to keep shelves stocked, many people didn't realize that local farms still had plenty of fresh food available. They just didn't have a way to reach consumers directly. At the same time, small farms were losing restaurant and wholesale business and needed new ways to sell their products. Aina was created to close that gap, making it easy for people to discover nearby farms and shop from them directly, without middlemen.</p>

                            We first launched in April 2020 under the name Farms That Are Delivering, starting with a simple list of local farms around New York City offering direct-to-door delivery. The initial site was intentionally minimal with just a search bar where users could enter their address and instantly see nearby farms. It was clean, focused, and designed to get people what they needed, fast.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/farms.png" alt="farms that are delivering" class="farms"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>
                            As the site gained traction on social media and in the press, traffic took off. We were reaching over 1 million searches within the first three months. We reviewed more than 15,000 farms across the U.S. and hand-curated a directory of around 1,300 that offered local or nationwide delivery. For each one, we captured detailed information from product offerings to animal feed, breed, and butchering methods. As we dug into user behavior, we noticed a shift: people didn't just want to search, they wanted to browse. That insight shaped our next design update, where we added city and state-based categories for easier exploration. We also introduced a rotating headline to highlight what was possible to search, helping users instantly understand the full range of the site.</div>

                        <div>
                            As we continued to grow, we rebranded as Aina which means Hawaiian for 'land' or 'earth'. We began evolving the site with a more intentional focus on user experience. We refined the search flow, adjusted the design based on user behavior, and introduced features for both farmers and customers. With more farms reaching out to join, we added an 'Add My Farm' feature that let them create accounts and list their own products. On the customer side, we highlighted standout farms doing things differently like Parker Pastures, where cows graze year-round on Colorado's wild grasses, or Lava Lake Lamb, where sheep roam freely across a million acres in the Rockies. These curated spotlights helped users connect with the values behind the food and brought a richer, more story-driven experience to the platform.</div>

                            Many users in our community had big goals but didn't know how to get started. They felt stuck, overwhelmed, and unsure of what to do first. Without a clear way to break things down or stay organized, it was hard to make progress. The process of setting and managing goals felt confusing, and motivation often dropped off. We saw an opportunity to create a simple tool that could help people turn their ideas into action.</p>

                        The evening ritual guides you through three simple questions: What did you learn? What could you improve? What was your win? Taking time to reflect this way helps you build a growth mindset and sets you up for a better tomorrow.

                        After you finish your evening questions, it's time to plan tomorrow. Add or adjust your goals and to-dos, then drag them into your calendar to create a schedule that works for you.
