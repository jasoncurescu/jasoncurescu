                            Role:<br>
                            Senior product designer<br><br>
                            Responsibilities:<br>
                            Product Strategy & Leadership<br>
                            UI/UX Design & Product Development<br>
                            User Research & Validation<br>
                            AI Integration & Recruitment Tools<br>
                            Branding & Marketing<br>
                        </div>
                        <div>I joined Mogul as the first and only designer, stepping into a fast-paced environment where I had the chance to shape the product from the ground up. At the time, Mogul was a global content platform for women curating everything from articles and videos to courses and community discussions.<br><br>

                            As the company evolved into an AI-powered recruitment platform focused on inclusive hiring, my role evolved too. I worked across nearly every design touchpoint from branding, product, web, and app design collaborating closely with the CEO, CTO, engineering, and marketing teams. Whether it was building our first design system, creating the Mogul App from scratch, or designing tools that helped companies search through 700M+ profiles, my goal was always to create thoughtful, scalable solutions that moved the product and business forward.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>The Problem:<br>
                            We saw a growing challenge: companies were struggling to find and connect with candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. Since Mogul already had a strong community of diverse professionals, we recognized a real opportunity to bridge that gap. That's how Mogul Recruiter was born. An AI-powered sourcing tool designed to help companies surface talent across key diversity categories like gender, ethnicity, veteran status, and disability.<br><br>
                            
                            I led design from the ground up, collaborating closely with clients and our Customer Success team to understand real-world hiring workflows, pain points, and goals. But as we added new features, the product started to lose clarity. There were too many overlapping paths, and recruiters were getting lost between jobs, sourcing, and outreach. The experience had become fragmented and hard to navigate.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/oldrecruiter.png" alt="oldmogulrecruiter" class="mogul-pic"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Back to the drawing board:<br>
It became clear that we needed to simplify. The navigation felt heavy, the layout was noisy, and key workflows weren't obvious. I made it my priority to untangle the user experience, starting with flow mapping, breadboarding, and stakeholder interviews.<br><br>

I spent time digging into how recruiters actually used the tool, where they got stuck, where they expected features to live, and what slowed them down. After three rounds of iteration, we landed on a new structure that felt more focused, more intuitive, and got great feedback from our users.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/prototypes.png" alt="mogulprototypes" class="mogul-prototypes"></div>

                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>The update:<br>
                            The redesign centered on one big idea: clarity through structure. I reimagined the experience around a job-centric model housing everything (sourcing, candidate review, campaigns, and progress tracking) within each job. That shift helped eliminate the need to jump between sections and gave recruiters a single, focused space to get their work done.<br><br>
                            Inbox:<br>
                            To support day-to-day workflow, I also designed a new inbox system. A centralized view that keeps recruiters up to date with tasks, updates, and candidate activity.</div>

                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Sourcing:<br>
                            Sourcing is the foundation of the hiring process. It's the first step in identifying the right candidate for your role, helping you build a pool of talent that sets the stage for finding the perfect fit.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/sourcingrecruiter.png" alt="mogulsourcing" class="mogul-sourcing"></div>

                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Filters:<br>
                            I elevated one of our most unique features: the Diversity Categories filter. It's a core differentiator for Mogul, so I gave it more visibility in the UI to help teams prioritize inclusive hiring in a seamless, natural way.</div>

                        <div>Review:<br>
                            Once you've sourced candidates, you can review and manage all the ones you've saved. Recruiters have the option to sort by "Best Fit," which ranks candidates from most to least suitable based on their experience. There's also a "Top Potential" sort, which highlights candidates most likely to succeed in the role. Additionally, you can email candidates directly or remove them before moving forward with the campaign.</div>

                            Once all candidates are sourced, you can create custom email and text campaigns, with the flexibility to schedule them whenever it suits you. After each step, you'll receive analytics to track performance, helping you understand what worked and what could be improved on for the next round of emails or texts.</div>

                        <div>Aina is an online platform that connects people directly to over 1,300 sustainable farms across the U.S. It lets users search by location, product type, or delivery method, then links them straight to the farm to place an order. Aina highlights eco-conscious farms that prioritize sustainability, humane practices, and transparency, making it easier to shop local and support independent growers.<br><br>

                        <div>The problem:<br>
                            In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when grocery stores were struggling to keep shelves stocked, many people didn't realize that local farms still had plenty of fresh food available. They just didn't have a way to reach consumers directly. At the same time, small farms were losing restaurant and wholesale business and needed new ways to sell their products. Aina was created to close that gap, making it easy for people to discover nearby farms and shop from them directly, without middlemen.</div>
                        <div></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Launch:<br>
                            We first launched in April 2020 under the name Farms That Are Delivering, starting with a simple list of local farms around New York City offering direct-to-door delivery. The initial site was intentionally minimal with just a search bar where users could enter their address and instantly see nearby farms. It was clean, focused, and designed to get people what they needed, fast.</div>
                        <div><img src="images/farms.png" alt="farms that are delivering" class="farms"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="experience-content__section">
                        <div>Iterating:<br>
                            As the site gained traction on social media and in the press, traffic took off. We were reaching over 1 million searches within the first three months. We reviewed more than 15,000 farms across the U.S. and hand-curated a directory of around 1,300 that offered local or nationwide delivery. For each one, we captured detailed information from product offerings to animal feed, breed, and butchering methods. As we dug into user behavior, we noticed a shift: people didn't just want to search, they wanted to browse. That insight shaped our next design update, where we added city and state-based categories for easier exploration. We also introduced a rotating headline to highlight what was possible to search, helping users instantly understand the full range of the site.</div>

                        <div>Aina:<br>
                            As we continued to grow, we rebranded as Aina which means Hawaiian for 'land' or 'earth'. We began evolving the site with a more intentional focus on user experience. We refined the search flow, adjusted the design based on user behavior, and introduced features for both farmers and customers. With more farms reaching out to join, we added an 'Add My Farm' feature that let them create accounts and list their own products. On the customer side, we highlighted standout farms doing things differently like Parker Pastures, where cows graze year-round on Colorado's wild grasses, or Lava Lake Lamb, where sheep roam freely across a million acres in the Rockies. These curated spotlights helped users connect with the values behind the food and brought a richer, more story-driven experience to the platform.</div>

                        <div>Mogul app:<br>
                            The Mogul app started with a simple insight from our community. People had so many ideas and goals, but didn't know how to get started. They felt overwhelmed, stuck, and unsure of what to tackle first. We built the app to help with exactly that. It's a space where users can break down their goals, stay organized, and actually make progress without the stress. Whether it's something personal or professional, the Mogul app helps turn "someday" into something real.<br><br>
                            The problem:<br>
                            Our community at Mogul was full of ambitious, driven people but many of them shared the same struggle: they had big goals and ideas, but didn't know where to start. The process of setting and managing goals felt overwhelming and unclear. Without the right tools or structure, motivation dropped and progress stalled. There was a clear need for a simple, approachable way to help people turn their goals into action.<br><br>
                            Prototypes & testing:<br>
                            The first version of the Mogul App was designed as an extension of our website which was centered around community and content. But as we began prototyping and testing with users, a clear theme emerged: they wanted more than just connection. They wanted support. Through feedback and iteration, we discovered that what users really needed was a tool to help them stay focused, build better habits, and make meaningful progress toward their goals. That insight became the foundation for what the Mogul App became.</div>

                            We designed the Mogul App around two simple but powerful rituals. One to close out the day, and one to start fresh. In the evening, users reflect on what went well, what they learned, and what they'd like to improve. Then they plan tomorrow's goals and tasks, adding everything directly to their in-app calendar. In the morning, users begin with a clear overview of their day so they can move forward with purpose and focus.<br><br>
                            
                            By combining reflection, planning, and scheduling into one seamless flow, users stay grounded in their goals and can see how their small, daily actions build toward bigger outcomes.<br><br>
                            
                            We also included a community feed where users can share progress, ask questions, and support one another. Whether it's about personal growth or career goals, the feed creates space for encouragement and connection among people working to be their best.
